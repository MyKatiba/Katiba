# About Me & My Project

I am Moses Mtengo, a passionate software developer from Kenya who graduated with a BSc. in Telecommunications & IT from Machakos University in November 2025. My journey with Kotlin and modern UI development began during my time as a Google Developer Student Club Lead, where I organized Compose Camps to introduce fellow students to Jetpack Compose. This experience sparked a deep commitment to the Kotlin ecosystem, leading me to establish and lead the Kotlin User Group Machakos, where I continue mentoring developers in Kotlin Multiplatform technologies.

Beyond coding, I enjoy chess, gaming, and most importantly, building projects that create positive societal impact—solutions born from real problems I've witnessed firsthand.

## The Inspiration Behind Katiba

Katiba was inspired by Ng'ang'a Muigai, a Kenyan political activist who travels across the country teaching citizens about the 2010 Kenyan Constitution—one of the most progressive constitutions in the world. He realized that citizens' lack of constitutional knowledge allows leaders to neglect their responsibilities. Moved by his mission, I reached out and promised to support his work by building a free mobile app. Katiba empowers Kenyans to learn the constitution at their own pace, eliminating the barriers of purchasing physical copies and making constitutional education accessible anywhere, anytime.

## Technologies Used

Katiba is built with cutting-edge technologies including:
- **Kotlin 2.1.0** with **Compose Multiplatform 1.7.3** for shared Android/iOS UI
- **Navigation 3** for type-safe, modern navigation
- **Spring physics animations** in the bottom navigation bar for fluid, natural interactions
- **R8 optimizer** for smaller, faster release builds
- **Kotlin Coroutines** and **Serialization** for efficient async operations
- **Material Design 3** for a polished, accessible interface

This project represents my belief that technology should empower citizens and strengthen democracy through accessible education.
